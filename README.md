To run the server, run the following commands in two terminals:

`npm run watch`

`npm start`

You might need to edit a file (like `src/app.js` to trigger a server reload or just refresh the browser probably). Wait anywhere between 3 - 20 seconds and you should receive three `Uncaught (in promise)` console errors.
